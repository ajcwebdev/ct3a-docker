# Create T3 App

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

## Why are there `.js` files in here?

As per [T3-Axiom #3](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app/tree/next#3-typesafety-isnt-optional), we take typesafety as a first class citizen. Unfortunately, not all frameworks and plugins support TypeScript which means some of the configuration files have to be `.js` files.

We try to emphasize that these files are javascript for a reason, by explicitly declaring its type (`cjs` or `mjs`) depending on what's supported by the library it is used by. Also, all the `js` files in this project are still typechecked using a `@ts-check` comment at the top.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with the most basic configuration and then move on to more advanced configuration.
